        <h1>W02: GitHub Pages Hosting Setup</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Task: Setup hosting for your webpages.</li>
            <li>Purpose: Prepare a place to store your website to be seen live on the Internet.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
        <p>
          We will continue setting up a way to get our web pages live on
 the web. Last week we learned how to create pages using the Microsoft 
Visual Studio Code editor. Now we will continue by learning how to 
upload our files to GitHub. Then from there they can be seen on GitHub 
Pages. We can then share the website with an instructor or fellow 
students for
          collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Again, like last week, there are a number steps we will need
 to go through to get everything set up. You will be installing and 
setting up Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages. 
          </p>
          <p>
            If you aren’t familiar with Git there is a <a href="https://youtu.be/FsgEtgmh268">'What is Git?’</a>
 video you can watch, but basically Git keeps track of your project 
folder as you make changes to any of the files. You can commit to these 
changes, or decide you want to keep them, and then transfer or push our 
files to our project that is stored on GitHub servers. We will refer to 
the folder with all our project files as a repository or repo. That is a
 huge simplification of Git and Repositories, but we really aren’t going
 to go super in-depth with versioning control in this beginning level 
course. We are mainly using GitHub Pages because it’s a nice, free way 
to publish our website so it can be live on the Internet without having 
to pay for hosting or a domain. 
          </p>
        <h2><strong>Instructions</strong></h2>
        <p>Each list of steps is followed by a video demonstrating the same steps. <strong>Carefully</strong>follow each step in the order they are presented here.</p>
        <ol class="bigSteps">
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Sign up for a GitHub Account:</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Visit the
                <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github.com</a>
                website.
              </li> 
              <li>Click the 'Sign Up' button.</li>
              <li>You'll enter an email. Then click 'Continue'.</li> <li>Create
 a password that has to be at least 15 characters or 8 characters with a
 number and lowercase letter. Then click 'Continue'.</li>
              <li>Enter a username all in lowercase. <em>Use a professional name since this username will show up in the domain of your web projects.</em>
 You might show these links to future prospective employers. If you get a
 red 'X' to the left of your username, then someone else has already 
used that username and you need to choose a different one. <em>Don't forget the email, password, and username you used for this new GitHub account.</em> We will need them later.</li>
              <li>Enter 'n' for the next step unless you want email from them.</li>
              <li>At this point it wants to make sure you are human and 
it has you solve a few simple puzzles. Click 'Start puzzle' and follow 
the directions. Click 'Create account'.</li>
              <li>It will send a launch code to the email you listed. Use that launch code and enter it.</li>
              <li>You can skip any personalization questions by clicking the 'Skip Personalization' link near the bottom.</li>
              <p>The following video demonstrates the steps above. The 
last bit of the video should just show the launch code getting entered. 
You can just keep the account open on your browser while you go on to 
the next steps in the setup process.</p>
              </ol>

                <!-- START STEP -->
                <h2>Install Git on our computer</h2>
                <p>Click on and Follow only the Windows, Mac, or Linux Instructions.</p>
                <ul>
                  <button class="accordion">For Windows Users:</button>
                  <div class="panel">
                    <ol>
                      <li>Before downloading, check to make sure you don't already have Git installed on your computer</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Click on the 'Start' window icon on your computer in the bottom left of your screen.</li>
                        <li>Type 'cmd' to open the Command Prompt app. 
You should get the Command Prompt terminal to open. It doesn't matter 
what your prompt path is.</li>
                        <li>Type in <pre>git --version</pre> and hit enter.</li>
                        <p>You should now either see a git version 
number come up or a message that says something about how 'git' is not 
recognized. If you have a version number come up, you already have git 
installed and you don't need to install it. If you get the message that 
git is not recognized then you need to install it.</p>
                      </ul>
                      <li>To install Git for Windows. Go to <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">git-scm.com/downloads</a> and click on 'Windows' under Downloads. An .exe file should be downloaded.</li>
                      <li>Click that .exe file to open it and it will begin the process of installing Git.</li>
                      <li>Allow it to make changes to your device.</li>
                      <li>Click 'Next' through all of the setup windows leaving all the defaults as they are. There will be quite a few windows.</li>
                      <li>The last window will let you click 'Install' and click 'Finish'.</li>
                      <li>Open up a new Command Prompt window by closing
 the first Command Prompt window and start a new one by typing 'cmd' at 
the Windows start button in the bottom left of your screen again. At the
 prompt, type: <pre>git --version</pre> again if you want to see that it
 installed. You should now see the version number. (If you don't use a 
new Command Prompt window, you could get the same message you had before
 you installed Git.) </li>
                      <p>While we are still in the Command Prompt we 
will type in two more commands to set up our username and email that are
 associated with our GitHub account. Again it doesn't matter what the 
path prompt is. These are global settings so you can type them from any 
path prompt.</p> 
                      <li>The command is listed below, but make sure you
 use your own username and email between the "" quotes. Use the username
 and your email you used for the GitHub account. It will be different 
for everyone. Type:
                        <pre>git config --global user.name "<em>yourusername</em>"</pre>
                      and then hit enter. Nothing will happen if you did it right.
                      And then type:
                        <pre>git config --global user.email "<em>youremail@byui.edu</em>"</pre>
                      and then hit enter again.
                      </li>
                      <p>Now you have configured your Git to recognize your GitHub later.</p>

shown below.) If you get the message then click install and agree.</li>

                <h2>Set up Visual Studio Code with Git and GitHub</h2>
                <p>Our wdd130 folder will hold all our files and 
resources for all our projects and keep track of any changes we make. 
When we are ready, we want to then transfer the local files to our 
remote GitHub account.</p>
                <p>Before you start, make sure you have the previous 
step completed with Git installed and your git config username and email
 settings done.</p>
                <p>
                  Let's use the folder we set up last week called 
'wdd130' to become a repository in GitHub so we can eventually see our 
website online.</p>
                  <p>Remember we already had the 'aboutme' folder within
 wdd130 that contained our aboutme project. We had an index.html file 
and folder(s). The images folder had an image file in it.               
 </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Make sure the wdd130 folder is open in VSCode if 
it's not already open. If you have other folders open in VSCode that use
 git make sure you close them. You only want the one wdd130 folder open,
 otherwise you won't see the button you need to see in the next few 
steps.</li>
                  <li>Click the 'Source Control' icon in VSCode. (It's the 3rd one from the top on the left.)</li>
                  <li>Click the blue button that says 'Publish to 
GitHub'. If you don't see this button, make sure you have all other git 
repo folders closed.</li>
                  <li>Click 'Allow' if you get a message saying 'The extension 'GitHub' wants to sign in using GitHub.'</li>
                  <li>If you are prompted for an authorization for Visual Studio Code to Access GitHub, click 'Continue'.</li>
                  <li>If you are asked to allow the page to open 'Visual Studio Code', click 'Allow'. </li>
                  <li>You may also be asked to allow an extension to open this URI, click 'Open'.</li>
                  <li>VSCode will choose the folder you have open, the 
wdd130 folder as the the repository and give you the option to 'Publish 
to GitHub public repository'. <strong>Choose the one that says 'public', not 'private'.</strong> This will make a new public repository in our GitHub account.</li>
                  <li>It will show a list of all the files in the wdd130
 folder. They will all be selected by default so just click 'OK' to 
include all files in the new respository.</li>
                  <li>If you get a message asking if you'd like to periodically run fetch you can say 'Yes'.</li>
                  <li>You can see in your GitHub account the new 
repository there and the files there that now mirror the files in the 
wdd130 folder you have on your computer</li>
                  <li>Now we will only have to 'push' any changes or additions to GitHub.</li>
                  <p>The following video demonstrates the steps above. I
 used a Mac computer with this video. Windows computers won't have the 
.DS_Store file.</p>

                <h2>Starting our Home Page</h2>
                <p>Let's start a new index.html page (Home Page) inside our repository.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>In VSCode open the Explorer panel and add a file 
to the wdd130 folder called index.html. This index.html is different 
from the index.html inside of aboutme. It will be the home page of our 
entire repository (wdd130) folder.</li>

                  <h2>Setting up GitHub Pages</h2>
                  <p>Let's set it up so we can see our GitHub files as live web pages on the Internet. We're almost there. Hang in there.</p>
                  <ol>
                    
                  <li>Let's see this page live on the Internet by 
setting up GitHub pages. Go back to the GitHub.com account. Click 
'Settings' with the gear icon. In the submenu that appears to the left 
choose 'Pages'</li>
                  <li>In the 'Source' section click the button that says
 'None' and change it to the 'main' branch, leave the next one at 'root'
 and click 'Save'. Your branch could be named 'master' instead of 'main'
 and that's fine. You will only have one branch to choose from there.</li>
                  <li>Above that a section you will get a colored area 
that says 'Your site is ready to be published at ...' with the name of 
your URL that can be used by anyone to see your website. Woo Hoo! We did
 it.</li>
                  <li>Give it a few minutes for your home page to show up. You might need to refresh the page after a few minutes.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The following video demonstrates the steps of GitHub Pages.</p>

                <h2>Practice with Pushing all our additions and edits for our project to GitHub</h2>
                <p>Let's add another HTML element to our page to see how we will push our edits and additions of our project to GitHub</p>
                <p>This step is all you will need to do from this point 
on as you edit and make additions to your projects. All previous steps 
were just setup.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>In VSCode open the Explorer panel and let's add a paragraph to the index.html. You can add it below the navigation.</li>

                  <li>As you save this file you will notice another blue
 circle number show up on our Source Control icon. Our local Git noticed
 the change in our file in our repository.</li>
                  <li>Click the + sign next to the index.html file.</li>
                  <li>Now commit the change to our local repository by 
adding a message to the 'Message' input box that describes what changes 
we've made. Something like: 'Added a paragraph to the home page'.</li>
                  <li>Click the check mark to the right of your repository name.</li>
                  <li>Now send those changes to the remote repository by
 clicking the 'More actions' ... (3 dots) and choose 'Push' from the pop
 up menu. This will send the index.html to GitHub.</li>
                  <li>Give it a few minutes to update on GitHub, but 
when you go to your GitHub Pages URL (web address) you should see the
